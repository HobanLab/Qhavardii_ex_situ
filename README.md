<h1>Quercus havardii- genetic diversity in ex situ collections</1h>
Raw data and R scripts for analyzing Quercus havardii genetic diversity in both in situ populations and ex situ collections, and for producing Figures for papers in preparation.
<h2>Overview</h2>
It is important to conserve genetic diversity in botanic gardens, to ensure their resilience into the future.  To ensure this we can measure genetic diversity directly or measure the breadth of geography and ecological diversity conserved.  The number of samples and how to collect them in the field (e.g. number of populations to visit) in order to ensure genetic diversity conservation, is not known.  Recent work has looked at minimum sample sizes to conserve rare species, but there are few if any guidelines for seed sampling for widespread but locally rare and threatened species.  We investigate this in the IUCN Red List Threatened species Quercus havardii, a desert adapted oak found in the Western United States in two disjunct regions.  We quantify how much genetic diversity is conserved in each of numerous botanic gardens, and we resample the in situ genetic data to determine minimum sample sizes with 'ideal' sampling according to best practice guidelines.
